# Setting Up Python on Your Mac: A GitHub-Friendly Guide üêç

Are you ready to kickstart your coding journey on your Mac? Python, the versatile and beginner-friendly programming language, is the perfect companion. This guide will walk you through the setup process on your Mac, making it not only easy but also enjoyable.

## Step 1: Open Terminal

The Terminal is your gateway to the programming world. Open it up on your Mac to get started.

## Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is your go-to tool for managing software on macOS. Copy and paste this command into your Terminal to install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
## Step 3: Install Python Using Homebrew

With Homebrew in place, installing Python is a breeze. Run this command in your Terminal:

```bash
brew install python
```

## Step 4: Verify Python Installation

Check if Python is installed successfully by running the following commands:

```bash
python3 --version
```

This should display the installed Python version. For example, "Python 3.9.7."

## Step 5: Install a Code Editor (Optional)

While you can write Python code in any text editor, using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Atom can enhance your coding experience.

## Step 6: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

A virtual environment allows you to create isolated Python environments for different projects. It helps manage dependencies and avoids conflicts between projects. To create a virtual environment, run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 7: Write Your First Python Script

Create a new Python file using your preferred code editor and write a simple script. For example:

```bash
print("Hello, Mac Python Coder!")
```

Save the file with a ".py" extension, like hello.py.

## Step 8: Run Your Python Script

In Terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. Use the following command to run the script:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

Voila! You've officially set up Python on your Mac and executed your inaugural Python script. Welcome to the exciting world of coding!
